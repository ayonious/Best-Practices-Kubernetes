#S3 (Scalable storage in the cloud)

bucket: Its similar to "repository" of "Ec2 container seervice in aws"


## 1. Create user

1. As first step you need to create a user in aws
2. Attach the user with a policy of "AmazonS3"
3. From security credentials "create Access Key" write down the "Access key id". When creating the access key you will be able to download the "AWS Secret Access Key" write that down too (careful this key you get to download only once)


## 2. Push a docker image in AWS-Ec2 container service


1. From aws dashboard goto EC2 container Service
2. Create a new repository (write down the name of the repo)

#get list of all folders so far
aws s3 ls s3://$awsBucketName;

#upload everything in the local dir to cloud
aws s3 sync . s3://$awsBucketName/$snapshotName;

#download everything from the cloud to the local dir
aws s3 sync s3://$awsBucketName/$snapshotName .;

#remove the cloud bucket
aws s3 rm s3://$awsBucketName --recursive;
