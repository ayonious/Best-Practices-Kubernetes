#EC2 Container Service (Run and manage docker Containers)

## 1. Create user

1. As first step you need to create a user in aws
2. Attach the user with a policy of "AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess"
3. From security credentials "create Access Key" write down the "Access key id". When creating the access key you will be able to download the "AWS Secret Access Key" write that down too (careful this key you get to download only once)


## 2. Push a docker image in AWS-Ec2 container service


1. From aws dashboard goto EC2 container Service
2. Create a new repository (write down the name of the repo)


A repository is basically a place where you store a collection of docker images in this case
Now click on the button "View push commands" to see necesary command necessary to push docker images in this repo

Suppose you have already create the image in your local pc. Now you want to push this image to aws. Here is an example script that pushes the image to aws:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXX;
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXX;
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=XXXXXXXX;

awsEcrRepository="XXXXX.amazonaws.com/XXXXXX"

#this line is for loginto aws
$(aws ecr get-login --region "$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION")

#now push the images
docker push "$awsEcrRepository":<your_tag_name>
```


If you dont want to use this above script and want to do it manually:

First set the variables in aws like this
>```
>aws configure
>```
>output
>```
>AWS Access Key ID : XXXXX
>AWS Secret Access Key : XXX
>Default region name : XXX
>Default output format [None]:
>```

Secondly run this
```
aws ecr get-login --region "########"
```
it will generate a command which you just need to copy and paste entirely in shell and you will see "LOGING SUCCESSFUL" message now you can pull/push images



## 2. Pull a docker image in AWS-Ec2 container service


```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXX;
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXX;
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=XXXXXXXX;

awsEcrRepository="XXXXX.amazonaws.com/XXXXXX"

#this line is for loginto aws
$(aws ecr get-login --region "$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION")

#now pull the images
docker pull "$awsEcrRepository":<your_tag_name>
```
